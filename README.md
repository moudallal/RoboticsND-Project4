## Project Requirements

- Simulate previous robot inside a simulation world
- Set up RTAB-Map (Real-Time Appearance Based Mapping)
- Map the simulation environment
- Setup RGB-D camera inside Gazebo
- Create `mapping.launch` and `localization.launch` files
- Control robot using `teleop`
- Build mapping database found [here]()

<!-- The requirements of this project were met as approved by Udacity's reviewers. -->
